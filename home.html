        <p>...someone is a member, it is told, of the famous somebody family,
            from a famous town of someplace,
            which is known for numerous stories, about veils of secrecy surrounding it instead of high impenetrable walls,
            and the most mysterious of all someplace stories is the one according to which
            in many other unknown towns live all the unknown authors of the world,
            and these very towns are where all the other, more or less famous mysterious stories are originating from.
            stories without words, beginnings, ends and characters,
            stories that are self-discovered in many different places and scattered voluntarily around the world, reveal themselves
            only to the rare people, who have the gentlest, most acute ears.
            and these people then try to pass the stories further on, with all their available and unavailable forces,
            because these people feel a part of a story bigger than themselves,
            and feel honored they were the very ones chosen by the stories to be revealed to,
            so these people have no choice but to use the stories as best they can.
            since, many of these people become the unknown authors from numerous unknown towns,
            and reveal from mystery the stories miraculously cocooned in them,
            and serve as faithful messengers,
            from the unknown to the known side of all world and time.
            and it remains therefore to somebody that, in all their ability, good will, and available time, they pass on and reveal to other people all the mysterious stories at their hand...</p>
